          <p><strong>Software Engineer</strong></p>
          <p>I love to develop scalable, clean, and purposeful code. Currently a software engineer intern at Autodesk in
            beautiful Montreal. Started programming at the age of 15 with Python and was hooked ever since. I try my
            best as
            an engineer to always maintain a customer oriented approach in my mindset, as well as in my code. Right now,
            my favourite technologies include Python, React, and Docker.</p>

          <p><strong>Finance Enthusiast</strong></p>
          <p>Investment strategies, personal finance, and emergent fin-tech technologies such as robo-advisors and
            cryptocurrencies fascinate me. The power of software to help revolutionize how we shape the face of the
            economy
            intrigues me highly. Interested in long term investment strategies and the practical uses of technologies
            like blockchain. Excited by the potential of technology to empower one's financial life.

          <p><strong>Progression Obsessed</strong></p>
          <p>Could you imagine what life could be like if each of us individually strived to improve our weaknesses and
            double down on our strengths? Lover of all things self-improvement. I aim to utilize the power of long term
            incremental progress throughout my day to day life. Whether that be physical health, programming, finances,
            and of course my relationships. After all, do we really have anything better to do than work on getting
            better?</p>
